# rginx

rginx is an ode to the best web server available (NGINX), however it is very very VERY basic in comparison to that. Honestly it will only be used to host my blog.

## Installation

Just clone and use, no dependencies needed.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GabrielOAzevedo/rginx.git
```

## Usage

Put your files in the public folder, let the code do the rest (hopefully).

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

(Your time would be better used elsewhere though)

## License
There is no license, you are welcome to do whatever you wish with this.
